                An NGO that aspires to become Lebanon's number one and
                help it and its people get back on their feet.
                Our goals are helping people who are struggling to make
                ends meet through financial support, helping poor kids
                such as those in tents or orphanages, both mentally by
                playing with them and entertaining them, and financially
                by providing them with food and clothing in the winter.
                We have many plans for the future, like opening schools
                and education centers, and we will work very hard to achieve
                them and get Lebanon back to the heaven it always have been!

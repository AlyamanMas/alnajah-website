                            <p class="p-about">
                                It's well known that many in Lebanon have been struggling
                                to afford food and clothes. The poverty rate has been
                                constantly increasing. Yet a decent life is a human
                                right that everyone should have access to. Thus we work
                                very hard to gather donations and distribute them to
                                those struggling to make ends meet, those who are barely
                                able to afford food or clothing, many of whom live in
                                barely livable environments like tents.
                            </p>

                        <h4>Caring for Orphans</h4>
                        <p class="p-about">
                            Humans crave parental love and care. All children love their
                            mothers and fathers and need their care and affection to have
                            a healthy and joyful childhood experience. Unfortunately though,
                            not every child has his parents around, and it can leave deep scars
                            on the child. We believe every child should have someone that cares
                            for them like parents. If their parents aren't around, we will shower
                            them with love and affection until they crave no more and are satisfied.

                    <h4>Education</h4>
                    <p class="p-about">
                        Education is a fundamental human right. Without education, people can hardly live
                        a decent life and many goals like democracy and civilization become impossible to
                        grasp and reach. Though to our dismay, many in the world don't receive decent education,
                        if at all. In the camps and orphanages we have visited, we have seen many children who
                        are illiterate and lack basic math and English skills. We work hard to teach these kids
                        so their future shines as bright as the sun!

                        Millions of children are dying every day from hunger and diseases
                         that are made worse by undernutrition. No child should ever go hungry
                          or suffer from preventable sickness and disease because their basic
                           nutritional needs go unmet

                    <p class="p-about">
                        Poverty and education are inextricably linked, because people living
                         in poverty may stop going to school so they can work, which leaves them
                          without literacy and numeracy skills they need to further their careers.

                        It was a nice idea to visit old people. Not all
                        people have the passion  to visit the infirmary, thus we
                        decided to do that and let them remember that there
                        still some people thinking about them and hoping to help
                        them as much as they can.  so we went and spent 3 hours
                        with them, and tried to draw on their faces the smiles.

                        Many people lived rough life, due to their poor

                        their life like how others live, so we claimed your
                        donation and buy clothes, oven, refrigerator and other
                        necessities of life.
